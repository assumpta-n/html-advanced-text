                <dt>Angamardana</dt>
                <dd>'Angamardana' means gaining complete mastery over the limbs, organs, 
                    and other parts of the body. ​ True to its name, this practice revitalises 
                    the body on all levels including the muscles, circulatory system, skeletal structure, 
                    nervous system, and the basic energy system

                <dt>Surya Kriya</dt>
                <dd>Surya Kriya is a potent yogic practice of tremendous antiquity, designed as a holistic 
                    process for health, wellness, and complete inner wellbeing. “Surya” means “sun,” and “kriya” 
                    means “inner energy process.” Surya Kriya activates the solar plexus to raise the samat prana, 
                    or solar heat, in the system.
                </dd>
                <dt>Yogasanas</dt>
                <dd>Yogasanas are a way of aligning the inner system and adjusting it to the celestial geometry, 
                    thereby becoming in sync with the existence and naturally achieving a chemistry of healthfulness, 
                    joyfulness, blissfulness, and above all, balance.

                    If you consciously hold an asana, it can alter the way you think, feel, and experience life. 
                    This is what Hatha Yoga can do.
